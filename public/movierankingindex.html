<h3>Terra Nova</h3>
<p>I loved this Tv Show back in 20011, Created by Kelly Marcel.<br />
The Movie was about, earth been too polluted and scientists was able to breach through time-space and people can go, 81 millions years back in time.<br />
But quickly, a colonie of poeple (with Commander Taylor as leader), faced the chalenge to protect nature, since the same industrial lobbies was only about expoiting the resources<br />
Unfortunatly this Sci-fi Tv show was cut short, and only the first season was produced. <br />
So if you know the producers, please let them kmow I'm still waiting on them to finish this amazing tv Show. Lol
